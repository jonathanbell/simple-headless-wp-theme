# Simple Headless WordPress Theme

If you want to serve your WordPress install as a read-only JSON API, you can use this theme.

This theme will not show any front-end, and will redirect your homepage and any other page to your WP JSON API (for example, `GET /wp-json`)

This theme is useful when [using WordPress in a headless manner](https://dev.to/jchiatt/headless-wordpress-with-react).

## Installation

1.  Clone or download this repository
1.  Copy `config.ini.example` to `config.ini`
1.  Change the values inside `config.ini` to your front-end configuration
1.  Upload the theme to your WordPress back-end and activate it
